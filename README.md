# JavaScript Random Name Picker

This is a simple vanilla JavaScript program to pick random student names. JavaScript uses its loyal Math.random() function and challenges a student to show his/her answer. The students, also known as "Hungry Nerds", instead of getting afraid from the JavaScript, make fun of JavaScript and throw some random funny quotes as a reply.

## How to use?

 - The list of all students is already defined in the students array.
 - The function randomNamePicker() can be called to pick a random student
 - By default, the array of absent students is empty. If any students are absent, their exact names need to be written as comma separated strings. 
 - The random quotes array and the the random emoji array can be modified to make the program more hilarious.
